**Headline:** built with Next.js 16, React 19 & Tailwind 4. My new portfolio is live. ⚡

I’m excited to share my new developer portfolio, built from scratch to push the boundaries of modern web performance and design.

My goal was to create something that doesn't just "show" my work, but *demonstrates* it through the site itself.

**🛠️ The Tech Stack (Bleeding Edge):**
*   **Core:** Next.js 16 (App Router) & React 19
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (Zero-runtime styles)
*   **Motion:** Framer Motion for complex, GPU-accelerated animations
*   **Data:** Real-time GitHub GraphQL integration
*   **Vibe:** Glassmorphism UI with dynamic noise & blur effects

**✨ Key Features:**
*   Live GitHub Contribution Graph (Real-time data fetching)
*   Zero-latency page transitions
*   Fully responsive "Bento Grid" layout
*   100/100 Lighthouse Performance Score

It’s open-source and live. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the design and performance! 👇

## Option 3: "Story" Style (Personal Touch 📖)
**Good for connecting with your network.**

It’s finally done. ✅

For a long time, I wanted a portfolio that truly represented my skills as a frontend engineer. Something fast, accessible, and beautiful.

This weekend, I deployed my new site using the latest tech stack available: **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, and **Tailwind 4**.

Building this taught me a lot about the new React Server Components and optimizing animations for the web.

I'm currently open to new opportunities—feel free to reach out if you're looking for a developer who cares about the details.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Posting

1.  **Add a Video/GIF:** Don't just post the link! Record a 30-second screen capture of you scrolling through the site. LinkedIn specifically pushes posts with videos more than plain links.
2.  **First Comment:** Post the link to your GitHub repository in the *first comment*, not in the main post (LinkedIn's algorithm sometimes downranks posts that lead users "off-platform").
3.  **Tag People:** If anyone helped you or inspired you, tag them!
