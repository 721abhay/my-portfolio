# 🚀 Just Launched: My New Developer Portfolio! 🌐

I'm excited to share my latest personal project - a completely redesigned, high-performance developer portfolio! 🎨✨

I wanted to build something that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates my passion for modern web technologies and user experience design. This isn't just a static site; it's an interactive experience.

**🔥 Key Features:**
*   **Cinematic Experience:** Immersive Hero section with particle effects and `VelocityScroll`.
*   **Interactive Skills Lab:** A categorized, animated visualization of my technical stack (Frontend, Backend, AI & more).
*   **GitHub Integration:** A custom-built contribution graph and activity feed to show real-time coding stats. 📊
*   **Dynamic UI:** Glassmorphism, smooth scroll reveals, and micro-interactions using **Framer Motion**.
*   **Theme Support:** Fully responsive Dark/Light mode with a seamless toggle. 🌗
*   **Terminal Simulation:** A geeky, interactive terminal section for the CLI lovers! 💻

**🛠️ Built With:**
*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
*   **Icons:** Lucide React
*   **Deployment:** Vercel

Build performance and accessibility were top priorities, achieving a 100/100 Lighthouse score. ⚡
